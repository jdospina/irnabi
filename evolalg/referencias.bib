  abstract = {The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900 when
	the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option pricing
	formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow a Brownian
	motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous researchers have
	contributed to the theory. The present paper begins by deducing a
	set of restrictions on option pricing formulas from the assumption
	that investors prefer more to less. These restrictions are necessary
	conditions for a formula to be consistent with a rational pricing
	theory. Attention is given to the problems created when dividends
	are paid on the underlying common stock and when the terms of the
	option contract can be changed explicitly by a change in exercise
	price or implicitly by a shift in the investment or capital structure
	policy of the firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient
	to uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional assumptions
	are introduced to examine and extend the seminal Black-Scholes theory
	of option pricing. Explicit formulas for pricing both call and put
	options as well as for warrants and the new "down-and-out" option
	are derived. The effects of dividends and call provisions on the
	warrant price are examined. The possibilities for further extension
	of the theory to the pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.},
